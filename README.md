## Summary
In this project, I built an end-to-end AI document parser tailored for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. My primary focus was on ensuring a seamless experience for **Arabic content**, particularly handling diacritics (Harakat) which often pose a challenge for standard retrieval systems. I implemented a hybrid storage architecture combining relational data (SQL) and vector embeddings to meet the task's scalability and audit requirements.

## Features & Implementation

### 1. Document Processing & Chunking
Unlike standard character-based splitting, I implemented Semantic Chunking using langchain-experimental.

The Logic: The system analyzes the "Semantic Distance" between sentences using OpenAI embeddings. It only breaks a chunk when it detects a significant shift in the topic.

Why it matters: This directly addresses the Dynamic Chunking requirement and serves as a foundation for RAPTOR-style hierarchical retrieval, ensuring that context remains coherent and topic-focused

### 2. Hybrid Storage Strategy
- **Vector DB (FAISS):** I chose **FAISS** to store embeddings. It’s highly efficient for local development and offered much better stability on Windows during testing compared to other options like ChromaDB.
- **SQL DB (SQLite):** I used SQLite to manage document metadata (upload timestamps, chunk counts, etc.). This allows for structured auditing and relational queries that a Vector DB alone cannot handle.

### 3. Arabic Language Excellence
To handle Arabic diacritics (tashkeel) correctly, I utilized the `text-embedding-3-small` model. It successfully captures the underlying semantics whether the text is vocalized or not, ensuring robust retrieval for diverse Arabic documents.

### 4. Modern RAG Workflow
The system is built using **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**, providing a clean, modular, and future-proof pipeline for question-answering tasks.

## Architecture Decisions 
Semantic vs. Fixed Chunking: I pivoted from recursive splitting to Semantic Chunking. While it adds a slight delay during document ingestion, it drastically improves the quality of retrieved context by keeping related ideas together.

FAISS Stability: During development, I prioritized FAISS over ChromaDB due to its reliability in various Python environments, ensuring the demo works seamlessly for reviewers without environment-specific crashes.

SQLite Pragmatism: For a Junior Engineer task, SQLite provided the perfect balance between fulfilling the SQL requirement and keeping the deployment lightweight and portable.

## Benchmark Results
I conducted a small-scale benchmark using a 24-chunk Arabic document:
- **Retrieval Latency:** ~0.45 seconds (Very fast).
- **Retrieval Accuracy (Hit Rate):** 100% on direct questions; ~90% on nuanced semantic queries.
- **Arabic Support:** Successfully retrieved vocalized (مشكّلة) text using non-vocalized queries.

## Future Improvements
- **Hybrid Search:** Combining keyword-based search (BM25) with vector search to improve accuracy on technical terms.
- **Graph RAG:** To map relationships between entities within the documents.
- **Local LLM Support:** Leveraging the power of a local GPU (like an RTX 4060) to run models like Llama 3 or Mistral for enhanced privacy.
